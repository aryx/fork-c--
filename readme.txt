                    The Quick C-- Compiler

     ``A new perspective on programming-language infrastructure''
                                                         
This directory contains the source code for Quick C--.  If you write a
compiler that emits C--, we'll turn your C-- into efficient machine
code.  More information can be found at http://www.cminusminus.org.

To build the compiler from source code, see the install.txt document.  For
the curious, the install.txt document also contains some information about
how the source code is organized.

Once the compiler is built, to make effective use of it, you should
read the release notes in doc/release.ps.  The notes describe what
parts of the C-- specification are and are not currently supported.
You can also try `man qc--'.  Quick C-- is still under development, so
if there is a feature you need, please ask for it.
