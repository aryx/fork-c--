The name `Quick C--' belongs to us, but the code is available free for
any use in any field of endeavor.  You may redistribute Quick C-- in
whole or in part.  We ask that, as a matter of courtesy, you
acknowledge its source and include this readme.txt file.  You may modify
Quick C-- and create derived works, with which you may do as you like,
but the result may not be called Quick C-- without written consent.

We want absolutely everyone to be able to use Quick C-- with
confidence.  To that end, the software is placed in the public domain.
It is not protected by copyright, and it is not protected by a
``copyleft'' agreement like the one used by the Free Software
Foundation.
