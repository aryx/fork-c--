modifs:
 - gzip *.s in test2/
 - moved files a lot and split in many directories
 - use Makefile and syncweb instead of relying on noweb and mk

 - commons2/
 - parsing/
 - h_asdl/
 - TODO frontend/

related work:
 - LLVM
 - VPO
 - MLRISC

using so many extra tools make the job harder for people to join
  * mk vs make
  * noweb. It's conveninent to have access easily to the .mli without
    looking at the .nw. Also convenient to modify the .ml files directly.
  * the nopoly.mw trick  and weird operator like =<=
  * lua



on lindig:
 - like me:
    * use of literate programing (but not syncweb!)
    * =*=  trick :) and evilness of the polymorphic equal (but implicit 
      loading of it is bad; yet another magic stuff happening behind your back)
    * use of code generator a la tarzan for sexp (asdl)
    * does not like functor (cf asm.nw) and prefer objects sometimes

on cmm:
 - like pfff
    * srcmap.ml vs my full_charpos_table and embeded parse_info.ml
    * asdl vs lib-sexp and my ocaml.mk file
