modifs:
 - gzip *.s in test2/
 - moved files a lot

related work:
 - LLVM
 - VPO
 - MLRISC


on lindig:
 - using so many extra tools make the job harder for people to join
    * mk vs make
    * the nopoly trick  and weird operator like =<=
    * noweb
 - like me:
    * =*=  trick :) and evilness of the polymorphic equal (but implicit 
      loading of it is bad; yet another magic stuff happening behind your back)
    * use of literate programing (but not syncweb!)
