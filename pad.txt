modifs:
 - gzip *.s in test2/
 - moved files a lot
 - use Makefile and syncweb instead of relying on noweb and mk

related work:
 - LLVM
 - VPO
 - MLRISC

using so many extra tools make the job harder for people to join
  * mk vs make
  * the nopoly.mw trick  and weird operator like =<=
  * noweb

on lindig:
 - like me:
    * =*=  trick :) and evilness of the polymorphic equal (but implicit 
      loading of it is bad; yet another magic stuff happening behind your back)
    * use of literate programing (but not syncweb!)
    * use of code generator a la tarzan for sexp (asdl)

on cmm:
 - like pfff
    * srcmap.ml vs my full_charpos_table and embeded parse_info.ml
    * asdl vs lib-sexp and my ocaml.mk file
