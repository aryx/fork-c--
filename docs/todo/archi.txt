How the Compiler's Source Code is Organized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the compiler without any of the following information, but
if you want to hack on the compiler, this information may help.

The source code of the compiler is split into different directories. 
The top level Makefile knows the dependencies between them and makes
them in the right order.  Files shared by many directories go into the
lib/ directory which is initially empty.  Once all shared files are in
place development can be continued in the sub-directories and the
Makefile provided there. Refer to the Makefiles for the high level
targets available in each directory. The docs/ directory includes an
overview document index.nw.

Here are the directories:

    commons2/      Library of OCaml modules for pretty printing and
                   and parsing.

    h_asdl/       OCaml sources for the runtime system of AsdlGen
                 generated code.
    
    h_camlburg/   A burg implementation for OCaml; comes with its own
                  documentation.

    docs/        Various documents, manual pages, also an overview and design
                 problems.

    tests/      Code for testing.

    runtime/    The Quick C-- run-time system
    
    
    todo/interp/     Interpreter for C--. 

    todo/lua/        An interpreter for the embedded script language Lua.
