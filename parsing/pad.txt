from ../install.txt:

Some source files are generated by tools that are not included in the
distribution. You can compile the generated sources, but you cannot
change the specification that led to them, For example, the abstract
syntax for C-- is specified in ASDL. We provide the library files in
asdl/ and generated sources in gen/ such that you do not need the ASDL
generator. However, we do not provide the generator which means there is
no way to re-compile the ASDL specification.
